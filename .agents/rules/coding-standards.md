# AtomisticSkills Agent Project Coding Standards

These rules are universally applied across all aspects of this project. **You MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW them WITHOUT EXCEPTION.** Keep all processes clean, modular, and reliant on existing infrastructure.

## 1. Global Agent Guidelines
1. **Language**: All code and comments must be in **English**.
2. **Temporary Files**: All temporary log, validation, testing, and summary files must be created under `<project_root>/.agents/test` to maintain a clean project structure.
3. **Error Handling**: Avoid using `try...except` blocks unless absolutely necessary; ensure the code output expectation is static and predictable.
4. **Cleanup**: After implementation changes, clean up temporary test code for previous deprecated functions.
5. **Reusability**: Before implementing a new function, search whether the same function already exists in dependency packages. Do not reinvent the wheel.
6. **Imports**: Use **absolute imports** for Python projects.
7. **MCP Stability**: If there's any bug with MCP tool calling, pause any ongoing research and **debug the MCP tool**. Do not write custom scripts to bypass MCP tool failures. Debug and ensure the MCP tool is stable for production use.
8. **MCP Edits**: After modifying MCP files, ask the user to refresh to make the changes in MCP servers effective.
9. **Package Management**: Before installing, upgrading, downgrading, or removing any package, **ask for permission**.
10. **URL Validation**: After generating any URLs, always test whether the URL is valid by verifying it directly (e.g., curling).

## 2. Environment and Dependency Management
- **Environment Isolation**: You must use the appropriate isolated Conda environment depending on the module or skill being developed (see `@.agents/rules/mcp-environments.md`). The `base-agent` environment serves as the generic fallback for standard processing.
- **Dependency Versions**: Never globally force arbitrary PyTorch or library versions (e.g., do not globally demand `torch 2.9.1`). PyTorch and critical packages are rigorously managed per-environment by their respective `core_env.yaml` schemas in `conda-envs/*`.
- **Failures**: NEVER implement fallback functions when package imports fail. Debug the root cause and fix the environment configuration.


## 3. Documentation and Testing
- **Structure**: Create independent Python packages for each major functional module.
- **Docs**: Provide detailed docstrings (including type hints) for functions and classes. Modules require a `README.md`, and skills strictly follow `@.agents/rules/skill-standards.md`.
- **Testing**: MCP tool functionalities must include `pytest`-based unit tests placed in the `tests/` directory.

## 4. Security and Performance
- **Secrets**: All API keys must be passed through environment variables or local `.env` files. Never hardcode credentials.
- **Efficiency**: Use streaming processing for files with large memory footprints. Monitor memory usage and optimize iterative loops to prevent OOM errors.
- **Debugging Blocks**: Pause immediately if you encounter an "improper format stop reason" error to analyze the trigger condition.

## 5. Trajectory and Visualization Outputs
- **Dual export**: Any user-facing code that writes an ASE **`.traj`** file must also write **`basename.extxyz`** using `src.utils.structure_utils.export_trajectory_for_ovito()`. Standard OVITO does not read `.traj` (ASE binary); extended XYZ is the portable trajectory format.
- **Return keys**: MCP tools and wrappers should return `trajectory_path` (ASE) and `trajectory_path_ovito` (extxyz) when both exist. Point users to `.extxyz` or `relaxed_structure.cif` for OVITO; reserve `.traj` for ASE analysis and MD continuation.
- **No one-off fixes**: Do not document OVITO workarounds only in a single project README — follow `docs/trajectory_output.md` for all new relax/MD implementations and skills.
- **Central utility**: Do not copy-paste `ase.io.write(..., format="extxyz")` in skills; call `export_trajectory_for_ovito` so behavior stays consistent.
